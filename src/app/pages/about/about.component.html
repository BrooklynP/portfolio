                <h5>Details</h5>
                <p>I undertook 2 years of a BSc. course in producing video games using game engines such as unity.
                    I produced many 2D and 3D games such as working with a team of designers in order to create a 3D
                    racing
                    game. I also created desktop apps such as a sprite editing app. I was unfortunately unable to
                    complete
                    the course.
